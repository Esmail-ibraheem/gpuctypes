Do you wish that there were simple wrappers for GPU libraries in Python?
Like not pyopencl, pycuda, and (HIP library someday?) here, but just raw access to the APIs?
That's what gpuctypes does! While high level libraries have their place, the world needs more low level libraries.
Like gpuctypes. Welcome home.

Install with:
pip install gpuctypes

Use:
gpuctypes.hip
gpuctypes.cuda
gpuctypes.opencl

Current version is:
* ROCm 5.7.1
* CUDA 11.5
* OpenCL whatever is in Ubuntu 22.04
